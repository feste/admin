<h1>Syntax, Semantics, &amp; Philosophy of Language</h1>

<i>Islands</i>
<br />
Norbert Hornstein, Howard Lasnik and Juan Uriagereka (Linguistics) lead an NSF-funded investigation into Islands (syntactic configurations 
that block long-distance grammatical dependencies), combining the perspectives of psycholinguistics and syntactic theory. The project studied 
four features of Island effects. First, exactly which syntactic configurations are Islands, and how do languages differ in this? Second, can
<span id="para1" style="display:none">
Island effects be reduced to nongrammatical processes, as many have recently suggested? Here we demonstrated that some of the recent hypotheses
to this effect cannot be justified. Third, can some Islands be explained as constraints, not on syntactic dependencies, but on their 
pronunciation? Here we are motivated by the observation, pursued in work by Howard Lasnik, that elided constituents do not create Islands. 
Finally, we investigated experimental methods for getting finer and more reliable data on speaker responses to putative Islands. In general 
our results showed that the standard judgments of linguists are robust across the population, and also cannot be reduced to nongrammatical 
effects.</span>

<i>Quantification</i>
<br />
Studies of natural language quantification have played a prominent role in the development of syntactic and semantic theory. Paul Pietroski 
(Linguistics, Philosophy) and Jeff Lidz (Linguistics) (along with collaborators at Johns Hopkins and Yale) have been exploring the acquisition
and processing of quantifiers in order to identify how quantificational meanings are mentally represented. A novel aspect of this work is that  
<span id="para3" style="display:none">
it draws upon constraints of visual cognition and theories of numerical cognition to inform the linguistic representation of quantifiers. 
Recent work comparing "more" and "most" finds that both adults and young children display differences in accuracy when evaluating synonymous 
sentences containing these words. These kinds of results point to aspects of the representation of meaning that go beyond simple truth-conditions.

<i>Attitudes</i>
<br />
Another active area of research is the language used to describe cognitive states. Valentine Hacquard (Linguistics) joins Erin Eaker (Philosophy) 
in a research project, supported by the university's NSF-sponsored ADVANCE grant, studying the semantics, logic, and implicit ontology of sentences 
about beliefs and desires. In parallel, Valentine Hacquard and Jeff Lidz lead an NSF-funded project investigating the acquisition of the semantics and  
<span id="para4" style="display:none">
pragmatics of attitude verbs: how do children come to master the language of cognitive states? And how does this relate to their developing understanding 
of these states?

<i>Argument structure</i>
<br />
Jeff Lidz is also working with Alexander Williams (Linguistics, Philosophy) on issues of argument structure. Building on their previous studies of 
Kannada, Igbo, Mandarin, this research takes a cross-linguistic perspective. Differences among languages raise questions of acquisition, since heuristics 
that help the child learn one language may impede learning of another. So are the child's heuristics general enough to avoid such problems? Or are some  
<span id="para5" style="display:none">
language-types actually harder to acquire? One way languages differ is in how the syntax of a verb correlates with its meaning. Our group asks whether 
young children are inclined to expect some correlations and not others, and if so, how they come to these biases. Presently we are studying whether toddlers 
expect a verb to occur in clauses that name every participant in its event, even in languages where this is not grammatically required.
